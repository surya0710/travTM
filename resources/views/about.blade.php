          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <p class="text-center">Trav-TM was founded with a simple yet powerful vision—to make travel easy, accessible, and reliable for everyone. Over the years, we noticed that many travelers struggle with complicated visa processes, unpredictable flight prices, and unreliable service providers. That’s why Pooja Dogra, a seasoned professional with 25+ years of experience in the travel industry, decided to create a company that puts travelers first.</p>
          <p class="text-center mt-2">Trav-TM is a unit of Day Dreams, a company known for its expertise in travel marketing, hotel memberships, and student consultancy. While Trav-TM is a growing brand, its foundation is built on years of industry experience, giving us the ability to provide expert guidance in travel planning.</p>
